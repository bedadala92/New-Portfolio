I wanted my first blog post to be about Art or Programming or Coffee or something like that.
But it is such that, my first blog post will be about Law and Medical System and Immigration. Three issues that I'm utterly not qualified to talk about.

Wednesday April 5 2017. After 1.5 plates of Krishna Lunch, as the thought of leaving UF soon kicked in some nostalgia, I spotted a Life South Blood Donation Van on campus. I have only donated blood for the purpose of tests but never in a quantity that can save lives. Today is the day.
</br>
It was 1PM.</br>
The next 30 minutes they collected my data. So much data that my friends who write Python will approve it. It was the first time in my life someone sat next to me and actually read every single question in the Consent Form. It was kind of embarrassing actually. They asked questions about my sex life, visa status, ethnicity and if i ever was in jail. I honestly do not know how being in jail and donating blood are connected.</br>
1.30 PM</br>
After about 30 minutes of paperwork they said I'm not qualified to donate blood since I'm not in the US for at least 3 years. I'm neither disappointed nor pissed at the policy but just curious. I know the policy is drafted by people who have years of experience in these things but is this effective? I come from India, where need precedes policy. During the very early days of my time in America, my roommate met with an accident. His shoulder got dislocated while he was swimming. The time it took for the ambulance to arrive was a fraction of the time it took for him to see the doctor after we arrived at the hospital. Because, paperwork. This would have been the opposite in India.</br>
Which is better? as this blog gets older, I hope to find answers.
