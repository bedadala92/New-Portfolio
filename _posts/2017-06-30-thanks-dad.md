Today is my dad’s last day at work. This job has been a part of his routine for the last thirty years. I wasn’t by his side on the first day of his job and I’m not there today as well. Although I know the details of his job like what and where, I have never really experienced him doing his thing. It’s kinda similar to listening to a record vs seeing the artist perform live or may be it’s not.

All these hours in the last thirty years that I have not seen him, paid for my food, clothing, education and this MacBook Pro that I’m writing on now. Few things blend so much into our lives that a change will leave us either emotional or utterly clueless and my guess is that my father will experience the latter while I battle the former today.

For all I know, my father was diligent in doing his duties. He immensely respected his job (although he never wanted me to pursue the same career) and often got frustrated for not being on time. Of course people he interacted with at work might judge his performance better and may show some praise or raise red flags like my mom did calling him ‘overly dedicated’ but he sure as hell loved his job.

My sister has been an employee for four years now and I will start my hunt for a job in few weeks. When I have a job I’ll have many moments that I need to reach out to my father for advice and this time unlike in the past, he will be able to take my call at 11AM on a Weekday.

My dad was a teacher and his lessons for me will start from today.

Thanks dad!
