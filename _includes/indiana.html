1. Information Architecture & Content Strategy <br>
2. Accessibility and Usability (Planning and Testing)<br>
3. Graphic Design and User Interface Design<br>
At IU, I work closely with the <a href="https://ux.iu.edu/">User Experience Office</a> to implement the <a href="https://rivet.uits.iu.edu/">Rivet Design System</a> across all the applications developed by the <a href="https://ovpueit.indiana.edu/">Undergraduate Education Department</a>.<br><br>
Following are some of the projects that I contributed to:</p><div class="subHeading">User Centered Design Initiative:</div><div class="app"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16DXGGHYd_mZ2KjVpLaSlq3iBKXRzAY1d/view">Read the document here →</a></div><p>I spearheaded this initiative in developing a structured approach to building applications that are accessible to users with disabilities. Prior to this initiative, accessibility was just a item on the check-list before launching an application but with UCDI we have made accessibility a core aspect of the entire UX.<br>
