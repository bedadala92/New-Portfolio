These opportunities are research jobs, paid freelance help, building a team to work on passion projects, finding help with specific tasks etc.,
We followed <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methods/">Google’s Design Sprint methodology</a> to build our app prototype. These are the following steps involved in our sprint:</p><div class="subHeading">1. Understand:</div><p>To get a better understanding of the problem, we did a survey across the campus of University of Florida. We spoke to students and faculty in person and through online forums like
Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit. We got some interesting insights into how students hear about opportunities across campus. One such insight is that graduate students are much more
exposed to these opportunities than undergrads. This is because of the strong ties of graduate student community to research labs and faculty. We also spoke to a few student entrepreneurs who
about how they found their team, most of them said that they meet people through student organizations but this approach of opening collaboration only through a specific organizations
limit the opportunity to reach other talented and interested students across campus. Below are the stats for two such questions in our survey.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/surveyresults.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">2. Sketch:</div><p>Once we got a clear understanding of the problem and who our users are, we moved to the next phase in the design sprint. We analyzed various existing products that are similar in nature to our app.
Some of the products we studied are LinkedIn, AngelList (Job Portal apps) and 5 Miles (Marketplace app). From here we worked on developing a brand for our product. We explored various names and finally
decided on 'dotEdu' which conveys that the product has a niche market as college campus. Below is an extract from my notebook while exploring logo options for the product.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/sketches.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">3. Prototype:</div><p>After establishing a brand identity and drafting low fidelity wireframes, we moved on to the final task in our design process.
Developing a high fidelity prototype involved building on decision taken in the wireframes phase. My prototyping workflow included
Photoshop to design the pages and Framer Studio to develop interactions for the pages. Framer is a powerful tool that allows for prototyping
each layer in the Photoshop file. Below is the logo animation designed in framer followed by the various pages designed in photoshop.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/dotedurec.gif" style="width:50%; display: block; margin: auto;"/></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/doteduwf.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">4. Validate:</div><p>Although the final product is just a prototype, we wanted to validate our process by testing it with a few users.
We've made the prototype available to interact through a link generated by Framer Gallery.<br><br></p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/doteduflow.gif" style="width:30%; display: block; margin: auto;"/></div>
