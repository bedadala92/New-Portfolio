around this time they were trying to transform their business from a test prep brand that offers classes physically
into a digital brand that makes educational content. The website is also a e-commerce platform that
allows customers to purchase courses. Their original website was hardly getting any traffic and they wanted to use the website to promote
a new product launch. This website was going to serve the dual purpose of offering information regarding upcoming classes/batches and also information
regarding the courses they are offering through a tablet by partnering with Samsung.<br></p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/byjus_03.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Research:</div><p>Our first challenge was to figure what to showcase between the header and the footer of the website. With the help of the Byju's team we analyzed student testimonials to
understand why students are choosing Byju's over other test prep brands. After analyzing everything from physical testimonials to social media comments, we understood that
the biggest reason students are interested in Byju's are the teachers. These teachers fill up classrooms like the concert hall during the performance of a popular artist.
These are the same teachers in the interactive lessons offered through the Samsung tablet. We leveraged this as a strategy to promote the new tablet by showcasing the teachers in the homepage
banners.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/byjus_04.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Audit:</div><p>We next moved to strategizing how we can promote the new course content delivered through a Samsung tablet named 'Byju's Learning Kit'. We wanted to the design to answer the following questions for the user:<br>
1. Difference between this tablet and other forms of course delivery (physical/streaming etc.)<br>
2. How this tablet can better help them crack the exam<br>
3. What content is offered through the tablet<br>
4. Features of the tablet (Hardware + Software)<br>
5. How to buy the tablet<br>
Our team of copywriters and designers went to the whiteboard to solve the above questions by mapping out the user journey from discovering about the tablet to purchasing it.
As we hypothesized the different steps in the process, we came up with several keywords that would help us define Byju's as a brand. These are
Innovative, Comprehensive, Detailed and Simple. These adjectives later helped us in the visual design of the product pages.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus02"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/byjus_02.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div class="intro"><div class="subHeading">User Interface Design:</div><p>As the lead designer for the project, I was solely responsible for making the visual design style choices. I did an extensive research
to find how various brands are presenting their products to the user who comes to their website to find more information. One brand that solved this problem in
a beautiful yet intuitive way is Apple. We all agreed on a product page that breaks down the information into several components.<br>
1. Call to actions : Purchase buttons, Sub-navigation menu, Support forms<br>
2. Technical specifications: Hardware, software details<br>
3. Community reviews / Testimonials<br>
Along with the above breakdown of information on the page, I borrowed several other design elements like the sketches in their design specification documents and the live demo
of the product.</p><img style="width:100%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/byjus_05.png"/></div></section></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Takeaways:</div><p>After we launched the website, we saw a significant improve in the traffic. While this success cannot be attributed completely to the re-design,
our success was measured in terms of the number of people who chose to visit the 'Tablet learning' page after they came to the website. This project
was a great experience for me in understand product strategy and how design can contribute to it. By dissecting this process by other companies, I learned
some valuable lessons in how to choose what to show to the user when launching a new product.</p></div></section></div>
