My design philosophy and the reason I became a designer is inspired by the following quote by Steve Jobs:</div><div style="font-weight:300; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;" class="p">"There is something beyond what you see everyday…It’s the same thing that causes people to want to be poets instead of bankers. I think that same spirit can be put into products. People can sense that. And they love it."</div><div class="p">If you have an idea for a project or just want say hi, write to me at <span class="type">sandeepbedadala@gmail.com<br><br></div></div></section></div>
