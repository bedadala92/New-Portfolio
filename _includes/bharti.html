Their predominant customers are the urban population in Indian metros.
Since the launch of Bharti AXA digital services, the analytics team has found that, more than any other service, users are primarily visiting the website to learn about new plans.
Our goal is to address the needs of this user and remove the complexity in finding the right plan for him/her.</p><div class="subHeading">My role:</div><p>I worked as an <span style="font-weight:600">Information Architect</span> , lead <span style="font-weight:600">User Interface Designer</span> and as a liaison between the design team at <span style="font-weight:600">Purplemango</span> and the development team at <span style="font-weight:600">Havas Digital</span></p></div></section></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Research:</div><p>Our team already had some primary research available regarding the target audience and what the customer needs are. Our first task was to understand how this user will go about choosing an insurance plan in the real world scenario.
Our goal for this study was to understand how people communicate and what are the constraints that we can address in the homepage of the website.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_04.png"/><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><p>We studied how the real world conversation is translating into the information architecture in the old design. As the home of a large insurance company, there was an anxiety between the different components of the homepage, each trying to stand out.
It was clear that no hierarchy of information has been planned during the design of the website. We set out to solve this by the research we had in hand i.e, organizing the information on the homepage based on who our prime user is. Data informed us that the majority
of the website traffic is from customers who wanted to learn about new plans and who heard about Bharti AXA from a friend or colleague.</p></div></section></div></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_02.png"/><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><p>Customers are much more diligent while dealing with services like life insurance and wish to know as much as possible and will expect a service that tailors their situation.
This is why, the customer services department receives large number of phone calls for information even though it is available on the website. We set out to solve this problem by
improving the communication between the user and the website by enabling the website to ask the customer more questions, considering every possibility and suggesting with the best
results. Also, it should be easy for the customer to come back to his options as he/she decides that a plan does not suit them.</p></div></section></div></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_05.png"/><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><p>Rather than forcing the customer to buy the plan without giving him enough details and to allow for getting as much information as possible through the website, we proposed a simple yet powerful
tool i.e, the premium calculator. Customers can calculate the premium details of a particular plan through an interactive calculator without having to share any sensible information or by having to call
the customer services department. Only when the customer is satisfied with the particulars of the plan, he/she is prompted to make a purchase.</p></div></section></div></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_03.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Testing:</div><p>To validate our research, we conducted simple A/B testing with real customers. We requested the customer service department to share the link of the new design to the customers that reach them through emails. We carried out this test for 24 hours to see
if there are any significant differences between the two based on a few metrics. Here are the results:<br>
1. Time spent on the website has improved by 6%<br>
2. 45% of the people who chose to view the plan details, have used the interactive calculator to calculate the premium<br>
3. While there is no change in the number of customers who proceeded with purchasing the plan, a significant number of people used the contact tools on the website for questions.</p><div class="subHeading">User Interface Design:</div><p>As we understood that the majority of the people who come to know about Bharti AXA, find about it through word of mouth and advertisement campaigns, we wanted to the customers to retain that sense of trust
with the brand through design. We leveraged testimonials to build this trust by embedding them in the homepage where they can be noticed easily. We retained the consistency of using stock photos for the banners in the website and used
stock images to build easy visual connection to the different insurance plans. I designed the interactive calculator by designing simple icons that are consistent with the brand design guidelines and that are easy to identify. As we planned this website
to be responsive, many design decisions were carefully made so as to provide a seamless mobile experience for the same design. These decisions include employing a box layout, where each component of the website has a shared set of properties in terms of the visual
style and break down easily on mobile.</p></div></section></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_01.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><div class="subHeading">Takeaways:</div><p>This project was a great experience in working with a large organization in a complex industry like insurance. My biggest takeaway working on this project is the
importance of human centered design and understanding how to implement it. The best way to solve a problem through a digital service is by best reflecting the real world scenarios
while improving it through beautiful design. Through first hand experience I understood how a designer can contribute the the workflow of the engineering teams and importance of research in making design decisions.</p></div></section></div>
