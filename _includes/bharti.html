<span><span style="color: #da1c1d;font-weight:500">'Jeevan Suraksha Ka Naya Nazariya'</span> is the brand slogan for Bharti AXA in Hindi. It means <span style="color: #184694;font-weight:500">'A new way to look at
life insurance'</span>. This slogan also served as the purpose of re-designing the brand's website. I was a part of the design team at
Purplemango India that designed both the web and mobile applications of Bharti AXA in 2014.</span>
<span>Bharti AXA is an insurance company in India. I worked on the re-design of their life insurance plan's website and
mobile application during my time at Purplemango India. </span></p></div></section></div><div id="byjus01"><img src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/bharti_01.png"/></div><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div style="margin-top:0px" class="intro"><p>Bharti AXA was my most challenging assignment at Purplemango. Being an established brand, it was easy adhering to existing brand
guidelines but to design an entirely new digital experience from well recognized design elements is a challenge. Moreover, for
the website is not just a place for their corporate information but a place where its customers make transactions, consult customer care
regularly and read through all the information diligently, since it involves their hard earned money.</br>
The goal is to design a smooth, unobtrusive digital experience. A place where the customer can find any information and get any help
they need at any stage in the process. One of the most important feature is the calculators. Basically the customer can calculate his/her
premium online by providing some information. I designed most of the calculators found in the website and 3 years later, after another re-design
the calculator design still remains the same.</br>
During the project, I was working closely with a team of developers at Havas Digital in Bangalore and the marketing team from Bharti AXA in Bombay.</p></div></section></div>
