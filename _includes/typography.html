This sounds overwhelming but how the nation works as a multilingual society is fascinating.
One might wonder how the governance is done and how decisions are made at the central level given that laws and policies are made for
people of all languages. I was curious about how languages evolved over the years in the subcontinent, story of early
printing presses in the co untry and the important milestones in developing digital typefaces for Indian languages.
After a comprehensive review of existing literature on this subject, I made a web story from the information collected.<br><br></p><img style="width:100%; margin-bottom:1%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/typo_collage.png"/><div class="subHeading">Storyboarding:</div><p>The story is divided into three parts based on the timeline of events.<br>
1. Evolution and classification<br>
2. Arrival of the printing press<br>
3. Development of digital typefaces<br></p><img style="width:100%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/storyboard01.png"/><h7><span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Evolution and classification</span><br></h7><p>First part of the story discusses how language has evolved in India and the classification of Indian scripts.</p><img style="width:100%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/storyboard02.png"/><h7><span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Arrival of the printing press</span></h7><p>Arrival of the printing press also marked the colonization of Indian states. Although early presses printed religious texts
like the Bible in local languages, over the years they served the purpose of spreading the spark of independence movement among
Indians. In the story, some key events like the establishment of Jesuit missionary in Goa and the contributions of people like William Carey
are discussed.</p><img style="width:100%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/storyboard03.png"/><h7><span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Development of digital typefaces</span></br></h7><p>The last part of this story talks about the current trends in developing typefaces for Indic scripts, standards and the organizations behind it.
Some of the challenges in developing typefaces like the complex structure of Devnagari alphabet are discussed. Finally the story ends by discussing the
future opportunities and challenges for digital typefaces in India.</p><div class="subHeading">Visual Style:</div><p></p><img style="width:32%; float: right; margin-left:3%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/darjeeling.jpg"/><p>Visual style of this project was inspired by colors and intricate details of Indian culture and landscape. One visual reference was Wes Anderson's 2007 movie 'The Darjeeling Limited'.
In the movie Anderson creates a mood through color that immerses the viewer completely in the world he narrates. I tried to achieve this in my project by creating
smooth parallax transition between each page and maintaining a consistence in colors across the pages. At places I have used animation to effectively communicate the story and
some interactive elements to engage the user with the story.</p><img style="width:65%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/colors.png"/></div></section></div><img style="width:100%; margin-top:1%" src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/darjeeling_sc.png"/><div class="home-wrap"><div class="header-position"><div class="heading"></div></div><section class="about"><div class="intro"><div class="subHeading">References:</div><p>I have made a collection of research papers, guides and general literature on Indian Typography <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6TkgVqfgAwXa1Y3ZzZZQURoeVU?usp=sharing">here.</a><br>
