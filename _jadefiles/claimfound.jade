      Building Trust through Design

        Visual Design:
      p.
        During the discovery process, I conducted interviews with the founders and other team members to find identify the different themes that are core to the product that we are building. This interview process was a soul searching activity to find out the visual elements that defines the brand. We have identified that 'search' is the core idea of our brand and 'completion','assistance' and 'fast' are the associated themes.
        It was important to show that ClaimFound as a brand assists with the whole process from finding to receiving the money. Retaining the importance of the search signifier i.e the magnifying glass, I came up with a logo that abstractly holds the form of the magnifying glass but connects to the idea of searching for claims in a different visual perspective achieved through a tinted primary color.

        As we found out during the initial usability test by talking to real users, trust is of paramount importance in establishing a strong customer relationship.
        From logo design to the user experience design, every design decision was made to make every interaction transparent and make the user feel that they are in control the whole time.

        Roboto, a clean sans-serif typeface with balance and legibility and whose properties align well with the shape and structure of the logo is chosen to be the primary typeface for the brand.

        Building a visual design system:
      p.
        To achieve an un-obtrusive, seamless digital experience, we developed a visual design system which is basically a library of all the UI elements we identified from the old design i.e, call to action buttons, forms etc. This library was revised multiple times by revisiting the information architecture and revising the UI wherever necessary i.e, eliminating the unnecessary call to actions and employing copy that complements with the user actions.

      p.
        Following are some of the UI screens designed based on the visual design system.
      <div style="position: relative; overflow: auto; max-width: 100%; height:auto; ">
      <img style="width:85%; margin-left: 15%;z-index: 3; position: relative ", src="/assets/img/hp_gallery_tn/hp_tn_11_claim_UX_01.png">
