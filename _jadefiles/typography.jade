        There are 22 official languages in India. This sounds overwhelming but how the nation works as a multilingual society is fascinating.
        One might wonder how the governance is done and how decisions are made at the central level given that laws and policies are made for
        people of all languages. I was curious about how languages evolved over the years in the subcontinent, story of early
        printing presses in the country and the important milestones in developing digital typefaces for Indian languages.
        After a comprehensive review of existing literature on this subject, I made a web story from the information collected.<br><br>

      <span style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:700">Storyboarding:</span><br>
      p.
        The story is divided into three parts based on the timeline of events.<br>
        1. Evolution and classification<br>
        2. Arrival of the printing press<br>
        3. Development of digital typefaces<br>

        <span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Evolution and classification</span><br>
      p.
        First part of the story discusses how language has evolved in India and the classification of Indian scripts.

        <span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Arrival of the printing press</span>
      p.
        Arrival of the printing press also marked the colonization of Indian states. Although early presses printed religious texts
        like the Bible in local languages, over the years they served the purpose of spreading the spark of independence movement among
        Indians. In the story, some key events like the establishment of Jesuit missionary in Goa and the contributions of people like William Carey
        are discussed.

        <span style="font-size:14px; font-style:italic">Storyboard: Development of digital typefaces</span></br>
      p.
        The last part of this story talks about the current trends in developing typefaces for Indic scripts, standards and the organizations behind it.
        Some of the challenges in developing typefaces like the complex structure of Devnagari alphabet are discussed. Finally the story ends by discussing the
        future opportunities and challenges for digital typefaces in India.

        Visual style of this project was inspired by colors and intricate details of Indian culture and landscape. One visual reference was Wes Anderson's 2007 movie 'The Darjeeling Limited'.
        In the movie Anderson creates a mood through color that immerses the viewer completely in the world he narrates. I tried to achieve this in my project by creating
        smooth parallax transition between each page and maintaining a consistence in colors across the pages. At places I have used animation to effectively communicate the story and
        some interactive elements to engage the user with the story.
